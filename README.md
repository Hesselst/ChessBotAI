## to do 
if i forgot anything please lmk (;
- [x] Create the chessboard
- [x] Add the pieces to the chessboard
- [ ] Configured all of the following pieces:
- [ ] Pawn
- [ ] Bishop
- [ ] Knight
- [ ] Rook
- [ ] Queen
- [ ] King
- [ ] Game is fully functional with all the following functions:
- [ ] The correct pieces can take each other
- [ ] Pieces get moved to the side once they have been taken, and won't be able to move anymore
- [ ] The kings cant move close to each other
- [ ] Once king is checked, the only pieces able to move will be the ones that can get the king unchecked
- [ ] Detect checkmates
- [ ] If checkmate, game is over

Once i've somehow completed all of these steps above, i'll start working on the self learning enemy AI.
